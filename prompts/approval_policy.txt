- Valid vendor ID or supplier verification

### Business Purpose

### Duplicate Prevention
- Duplicate payments are strictly forbidden
- System checks invoice ID + supplier combination to prevent duplicates
- If duplicate detected, invoice will be flagged for review

### Invoice Date
- Must be within the past 180 days unless pre-approved
- System will flag invoices older than 180 days for review

- Above $300 requires manager approval
